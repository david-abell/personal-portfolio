## General Information

This is an easy to use alternative to the TFI Live transport App.

## Features

- Search public bus and train schedules across Ireland for their favorite travel routes.
- Save favorite transport stops for quick future access.
- View scheduled and real arrival estimates for upcoming trains and buses. No more wondering when your bus is actually supposed to arrive.
- Select trips to display current or estimated train or bus positions.

## Room for Improvement

- Integration with Geo SQL will allow searching for nearby stops in a map area, eliminating the need to know local bus and train routes.

## Lessons learned

- Next.JS server components are incompatible with Leaflet.js.
